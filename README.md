# AI-planning and decision making, applied to the terminal C1 Game

## [Correlation 1 Terminal](https://terminal.c1games.com/home)

We seek to develop an optimal algorithm for competition in the Correlation C1 terminal game. 

See demo video of our algorithm playing against the terminalc1 boss algorithm "IronClad"

The code of our algorithm can be viewed at:

We hope to continue to enhance and develop our algorithms moving forward! 
Here are our previous versions:
